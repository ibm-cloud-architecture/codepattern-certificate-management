# Manage SSL certificates for IBM Cloud VPC Load Balancer

### Architecture Goals

1. Given an [IBM Cloud VPC Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network---using-load-balancers-in-ibm-cloud-vpc) and its [LISTENER](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc-on-classic-network?topic=vpc-on-classic-network---using-load-balancers-in-ibm-cloud-vpc#front-end-listeners-and-back-end-pools), then create the minimum required services/configurations to provide a certificate for the Listener.
3 Demonstrate how the [IBM Cloud Certificate Management Service (CMS)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/certificate-manager) is required to order/hold the certificate. 
4. Show how to create an auth policy between LBaaS and CMS is also defined to enable the LBaaS LISTENER to read/write to the CMS.

### Description

This code pattern provides the necessary scripts to provision a basic VPC network with a Load Balancer as a service, and instance of IBM Certificate Manager Service (CMS) with access control policies for roles and for LBaaS to read from CMS. Then a certificate is ordered and loaded into the CMS service instance.

### Process

When you run this script it will

- create a certifcate manager instance
  - requests a certificate
  - loads certificate into cms
  
- create an instance of a VPC with
  - prefix address for a single zone
  - subnet in the zone
  - single VSI attached to subnet
  - LBaaS attached to subnet with a back end pool and listener
    - listener listens on https, port 443 and uses the certificate in the cms instance
    
- creates an access group 

- assigns access policy for
  - access group to access cms
  - LBaas to access cms to read certificate
